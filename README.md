# Cointegrated pairs trading
Trading strategy using bollinger bands with two cointegrated stocks - CAML and GLEN. 
These firms are both copper, zinc and lead miners, and thus the price of each one should mostly be similar to the other.
This strategy aims to take advantage of prices differences that occur and make profitable trades.
