This repository implements a statistical arbitrage trading strategy based on cointegrated pairs trading. The underlying idea is to identify two stocks 
whose prices move together over time due to an underlying economic or market relationship. When the price spread between the two temporarily diverges 
from its historical mean, the strategy enters a long/short trade to profit from the expected reversion.

The full details can be found in the Jupyter notebook.
