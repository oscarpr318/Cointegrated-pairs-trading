    "\n",
    "This repository implements a statistical arbitrage trading strategy based on cointegrated pairs trading. The underlying idea is to identify two stocks \n",
    "whose prices move together over time due to an underlying economic or market relationship. When the price spread between the two temporarily diverges \n",
    "from its historical mean, the strategy enters a long/short trade to profit from the expected reversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy uses historical price data of Glencore PLC (GLEN.L) and Central Asia Metals PLC (CAML.L), both of whom are copper, zinc and lead miners. \n",
    "It calculates a hedging ratio via linear regression, tests for cointegration, constructs a mean-reverting spread, and then uses z-score thresholds to \n",
    "determine entry and exit points. A backtesting framework simulates trading performance, including P&L tracking and stop-loss management.\n",

    "8. Evaluation of results\n",
    "\n",
    "The model does indeed return a positive total ROI of 18.81%, however this does not indicate future performance. Firstly, the annualized ROI is only 4.41%, which does not beat the stock market benchmark of ~10%. If our goal is to make money we could simply put it into index funds/ETF's that track the stock market and achieve a greater return with much lower risk. The negative daily and annualized Sharpe Ratio's imply that the risk-adjusted performance is very poor, and we could have achieved greater results with a risk-free asset. \n",

    "9. Key Assumptions & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pair Selection: Only CAML and GLEN are tested; no automated pair selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hedging Ratio: Uses correlation coefficient, not regression slope, which may under/over-hedge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stationarity: Assumes stable cointegration; structural breaks can invalidate the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - No transaction costs, slippage, or borrowing constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Positions fully filled at historical close prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hedging Ratio: Use regression slope (ββ) for more accurate hedging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic Thresholds: Optimize z-score entry/exit levels using historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expanded Pair Universe: Automatically identify cointegrated pairs via Engle-Granger or Johansen tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transaction Costs: Incorporate realistic execution costs to evaluate profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Risk Management: Introduce volatility-based sizing, drawdown limits, and capital allocation rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Live Trading: Integrate with a broker API (e.g., Interactive Brokers) for real-time execution."
